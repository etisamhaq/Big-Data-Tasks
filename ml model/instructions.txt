Multi-Container Application Development and Deployment 

Develop a ml model application consisting of multiple containers.  

DB Container: Run a MySQL database container, create a database named “Model_Logger” 
and create one table named “Log” with the following columns: 
ID
Current_Date_Time
Input_Params
Output
Response Time

ML Serving API in Flask: Use a pre-trained ML model and build a serving API around it.
The API should be able to accept input, generate output, log in to the database 
(running on another container), and return the result to the user. 

Also make a frontend for application.

Build a docker-compose.yml for containers. 

You can Run and stop the application through docker-compose.
